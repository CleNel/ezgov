PRAYER
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret
Grun Kibben, offered the following
prayer:
The CHAPLAIN. Holy and eternal
God, we come to You on this auspicious
day, a day of grief, a day of confusion,
a day of consternation.
We reflect on the horrific moments of
9/11, when the country was assaulted by
evil’s wicked hand, only to continue in
anguish when confronted with the
senseless violence of the assassination
of Charlie Kirk and the simultaneous
attack on high schoolers in Colorado
even just yesterday.
Gracious God, receive the agony that
resides in the depths of our hearts and
call up within us a deeper desire to re-
spond to these tragedies not with words
of animus or rancor that only deepen
the divide but to speak into these days
as representatives of Your peace.
Remind us again that our days are
short but our lives are in Your hands
and You call us to live even these days
as unto You.
Inspire us now to lead our commu-
nities toward more civil dialogue, to
turn the temperature down, and to rise
above the animosity and claim the re-
demption that can only be found in
You.
We turn to You with all that we are,
as we are, that You would use us to
proclaim Your peace. It is in the
strength of Your name I pray.
Amen.

REMEMBERING LEW THOMPSON
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given
permission to address the House for 1
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.)
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, on Au-
gust 26, Madison County, the State of
Arkansas, and the Nation’s trucking
industry lost a remarkable self-made
businessman when Lew Thompson of
Huntsville died unexpectedly at his
home. I lost a dear friend.
The Lew Thompson brand is synony-
mous with short-haul trucking, par-
ticularly in the live-haul business. His
iconic red trucks are recognizable all
over Arkansas and our Nation. Lew had
an entrepreneurial spirit, taking a one-
man show, hauling turkeys for Butter-
ball, to a major fleet of 700 trucks and
1,200 trailers. It is a rags-to-riches,
multimillion-dollar operation.
He had a huge heart for his home re-
gion and never forgot his roots and the
friends and family that contributed to
his enormous success.
I will never forget my last visit with
Lew and the folks at Lew Thompson &
Son Trucking the week before he
passed away. He was excited about the
future and now gone too soon.
Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences
to his wife, Carla; his son, Josh; his

daughter, Tiffany; and scores of ex-
tended family and friends. Rest in
peace, my dear friend.
f
FIGHTING NUTRITION CUTS
(Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania asked
and was given permission to address
the House for 1 minute and to revise
and extend her remarks.)
Ms. DEAN of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, in my suburban Philadelphia
district, more than 75,000 people strug-
gle with not enough food. They strug-
gle with hunger every single day.
That is why I voted against the cuts
to SNAP, our Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program. These cuts are
going into effect now, and my constitu-
ents will do with less. These nutrition
cuts hurt seniors, children, families,
and veterans. The Gospel of Matthew
teaches us to do better.
For I was naked and you clothed me;
I was a stranger, and you welcomed
me; a prisoner and you visited me; hun-
gry and you offered me food.
May we use the privilege of our
voices and our votes not to inflame but
to inspire.
f
HONORING MIRANDA DABNEY
(Mr. HERN of Oklahoma asked and
was given permission to address the
House for 1 minute and to revise and
extend his remarks.)
Mr. HERN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speak-
er, today I honor Miranda Dabney who
has served Oklahoma’s First District
with unwavering dedication since my
very first day in office.
For nearly 7 years, Miranda’s tireless
work and invaluable contributions
have been the cornerstone of our
team’s success. From shaping our mes-
sage to driving our mission forward,
her impact is immeasurable. We simply
would not be where we are today with-
out her.
I am immensely proud of her remark-
able achievements and the legacy she
